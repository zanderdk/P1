\section{Technology}

In this section we will describe some of the technological conditions that makes it possible, to construct a software solution to our initiating problem. \cref{sub:init} 
To navigate persons indoor it is important all ways find the most optimal route based on the users prerequisites. This makes way-finding Technology's very important to our project, we will cover this in \cref{sub:way}. For any way finding technique two parameters is requited start and end location. The start location can be determined by positioning the person, this is don using the methods described in \cref{sub:pos}.
positioning have some requirements that the infrastructure have to comply with, we will define the requirements in \cref{sub:infra}.
