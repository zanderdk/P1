\subsection{Administration}

This subsection will describe the impact indoor navigation has on the general effectiveness of the hospital and the three groups of administrative staff.\\
Hospitals can involve large and complex buildings \cite{wifi_navigation_ca} and welcomes numerous people every day. Some of those people are patients and others are the loved ones of those patients come to visit, some of whom may be entering for the first time. People who are not used to a hospital can become stressed or confused as they attempt to find an appointment, the cafeteria or the waiting rooms. As a consequence of this they ask the administrative staff for help. \cite{Frivillige_guider}

\paragraph{Regular staff}
This group can be split into several subgroups containing for example the receptionist and the administrative assistant. Members of the administrative staff are often the first employees visitors will meet in a hospital, and these employees can be split into two groups in terms of how well they know the building; the new employees and the veteran employees. A new staff member may have a hard time navigating visitors or patients around in a complex facility due to a lack of knowledge of the area, whereas the veteran staff should be more knowledgeable of the facility. Even so it can still be difficult to explain a route through the facility to a visitor. Explaining it is time consuming and it will interrupt what else they might have been working on which in turn may be stressful for the parliament, government and the minister-led ministries and the regional council \cite{arbejdsmiljo_ca}. If people visiting the hospital are to rely on the staff for navigation it also possesses a bottleneck as each employee can only communicate with one person at a time.

\paragraph{Board of directors and the region}
This group can be split into several subgroups containing for instance, economy, scheduling and quality. Normally these groups, don't meet up with the visitors directly, but these groups are indirectly affected by the visitors and the staff. If the staff are on a tight schedule, and they run into an unforeseen workload, their schedule will slip affecting the staff's appointments. The staff will then have to work overtime, and  will have to be paid accordingly, affecting the economy of the hospital. An inefficient hospital will cost more money for the region, and the work being done may be of lower quality. Money that otherwise could be used for something else \cite{timer_til_at_hjelpe_rundt}.

In the following we will cover which procedures are needed in order to realize a software solution for our initiating problem (\cref{sub:init}).

In a decision process the following phases will typically happen. \cite{Sjaelland}

	\item \textbf{Idea and initiative phase} A problem is defined by the citizens, media or political organization.
	\item \textbf{Preparing phase} The problem will be reviewed according to the health legislation.
	\item \textbf{Decision phase} The problem is presented and a committee is established. This committee will typically work with consultants to specify the requirements of the solution.
	\item \textbf{Implementation phase} The solution will be implemented. 
\end{itemize}

The highest court of the hospital is politically elected bodies: parliament, government and the minister-led ministries and the regional council. This was also the Regional Council on 21 September 2010 adopted Region Nordjylland budget for 2011 and a budget conciliation, which included a number of structural changes and cost savings for the hospitals in the region \cite{politisk_styret_ca}. Between the decision phase and the implementation phase, the project will be announced as a public supply contract for suppliers to tender a solution. \cite{Union2004}. Suppliers will then submit their solutions. The solution that fits the problem's requirements best, gets the contract.
