Hospitals have many different users, in this section the focus is "the administration group", namely "regular staff", "Board of Directors" and "The region". All three group have there different traits, and impact on the hospital, the focus in this sections, is what impact indoor navigations have on the global effectiveness in the hospital and the 3 three groups of administrations staff. Hospitals can involve large and complex buildings. Hospitals are every day welcoming new and returning visitors. Some customers are returning and others are loved ones to patients, maybe entering for the first time, people whom are not used to a hospital, can get stressed or confusion as they attempt to find an appointment, the cafeteria or the waiting rooms. As a consequence of this, they ask the administrative staff for help.

"Regular staff", this group can be split into several subgroups containing for instance, "the receptionist" and "administrative assistant". Administration staff are often the first  member you will meet in a hospital. These members can be split onto two groups as well, "new ones" and "old ones". A new staff member can have a hard time navigating visitors or patients around in a complex building and the old ones maybe know there way around, but it can be hard to explain a visitor, how to navigate around in a complex building. This takes time and effect there work, often patient can stress the staff, and while the staff is busy helping the lost patient or visitor, others can't get in contact with them, all this is also disturbing them from their work by phone or in the office.

"Board of Directors", this group can be split into several subgroups containing for instance, "economy" and "scheduling and quality", navigations on a hospital, can have a great impact on both  of these group, if and employee is distracted from his/her work, and they have multiply things to attend too, often a lost patient or a visitor will distract them, this will effect there work and may often end up in a stressed staff, while this effect there concentration and quality of there work, an unconsecrated employee can make mistakes, while there on a tight time schedule, and a unforeseen obstacle like a lost patient or a visitor, can push scheduling, and a result of this can cost the hospital a lot of time, money and stressed staff.
