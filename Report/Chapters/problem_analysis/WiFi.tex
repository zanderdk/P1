Wi-Fi can connect to the internet via a wireless access point such as a router. Wi-Fi allows places that normally would not have internet connection, like sheds or gardens, to connect. This is possible as the router or wireless access point will allow the device to get a connection.

This is widely used as they serve as an convient way of getting internet access. They are fairly easy to set up and used widely in the private homes and also used at a greater scale such as an airport\cite{wifi_works}. It is an convienient way of getting internet access as the user is in no need of getting a cable that psyically have to be connected to a router.

It is relevant for this project as there have been invested in installing Wi-Di hotspots at the Danish hospitals\cite{wifi_hospi}. This means it would be possible to set up a service that will connect trough these hotspots.
