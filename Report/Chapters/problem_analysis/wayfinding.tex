\subsection{Wayfinding}\label{subs:way}


Finding a path from a source, to a destination is question of searching. Search algorithms can be subdivide into uninformed and informed searches. Search algorithms use graph to perform a search and find a path, a graph is a representation of the environment the user is moving in, constructed of set of nodes and links between the nodes. 

\subsubsection{Uninformed}

When searching uninformed, all possible paths would be expanded until path to destination is found. Two types this of algorithm is breadth-first, depth-first, both expands nodes blindly.

\subsubsection{Informed}

Informed search on the other hand, if there is supplied information regarding the problem, it is possible to minimize number of computations, before a path is found, by guiding the algorithm with a heuristic value.
