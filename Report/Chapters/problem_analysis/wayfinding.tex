\subsection{Wayfinding}\label{sub:way}

Finding a path from a source, to a destination is a question of searching. Search algorithms can be subdivided into uninformed and informed searches. Search algorithms use graphs to perform a search and find a path.

\subsubsection{Uninformed}

When searching uninformed, all possible paths would be expanded until path to destination is reached. This means that the algorithms are expanding a lot of vertices blindly, without actually searching a path leading to the destination.

\subsubsection{Informed}

Informed search on the other hand, if there is supplied information regarding the problem, it is possible to minimize number of computations, before a path is found, by guiding the algorithm with a heuristic value.
