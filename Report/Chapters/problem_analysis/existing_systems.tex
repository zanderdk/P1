Signs
There are signs that marks different areas of the hospital. "Main entrance" and "Ambulance entrance" these signs can be used to mark key places that the visitor can navigate from.
There are also placed interior signs in the hospital. Signs painted to the walls, signs affixed to doors or windows and others hang from the ceiling.

Colour coding
Coloured stripes across the wall or floor that leads to the different areas of the hospital. In the entrance hall the visitors will se a wall with some lines of text with a coloured stripe behind it. One line might say "recovery" and if followed, will lead to the recovery department. Some departsment also have an entire theme in a certain colour.
