\subsection{GPS}

Global Positioning System, GPS is a satellite-based positioning system. Satellites emits a signal, a time-stamp and current position. A GPS receiver measures the distance from itself to any satellite, by the time it took to receive the signal at the speed of light. When the positions and distances of multiple of satellites is known, its possible determine the GPS receivers position by trilateration\cite{Dempster2013}. It is possible to use GPS all over the world as long as there a clear line of sight to the satellites. Due to the signals not being able to pass through walls and roofs, means that it is suitable for indoor use\cite{GPS_about}.
