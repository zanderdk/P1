gps
Global Positioning System (GPS), a system made of 24 satalite and some ground stations. By triangulering using 4 satalite you can calculate our position, thsi is done by calculating the time it takes to send a signal from the satalite  to  the receiver and multiplite it with the speed of lite. GPS signals is transmittet on low power radio signals, named L1 and L2, L1 is for civilians. the signals is a line of side, this will go through clouds, glass, and plastic, but not solid objects. the signal is build up by three different bits of code: a pseudorandom code (an algoritem to generate numbers close to random), [http://www.random.org/randomness/], this is an ID number, ephemeris data (this code have the time and date of the satalite, and tells if the satalite  is healthy or unhealty) and almanac data (tells others satalites where the sender satalite is on every moment on the day.) [http://www8.garmin.com/aboutGPS/] [http://gpsinformation.net/main/almanac.txt]. This is relevant for our topic to determent if we  can use GPS signal for indoor navigation, the main issue with the signal is, that solid object can block the signal, so it will be unusable indoor.
