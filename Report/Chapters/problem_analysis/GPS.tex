\subsection{GPS}
Global Positioning System (GPS), a system made of 24 satellites and some ground stations. By triangulating using 4 satellites you can calculate your position, this is done by calculating the time it takes to send a signal from the satellite to the receiver and multiply it with the speed of light. GPS signals is transmitted on low power radio signals, L1 and L2 where L1 is for civilians. The signals is able o go trough clouds, glass, and plastic, but not some solid objects like thick walls of concrete. the signal is build up by three different bits of code: a pseudo random code (an algorithm to generate numbers close to random)\cite{GPS_random}, this is an ID number, ephemeris data (this code have the time and date of the satellite, and tells if the satellite is damaged) and almanac data (tells others satellites where the sender satellite is, at every moment on the day)\cite{GPS_about,GPS_text}. This is relevant for our topic to determine if we  can use GPS signal for indoor navigation, the main issue with the signal is, that solid object can block the signal, so it will be unusable indoor.
