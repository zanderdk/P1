In this section we will cover which procedures are needed in order to realize a software solution for our initiating problem (\cref{sub:init}).

In a decision process the following phases will typically happen.

\begin{description}
	\item[Idea and initiative phase] A problem is defined by the citizens, media or political organisation.
	\item[Preparing phase] The problem will be reviewed according to the health legislation.
	\item[Decision phase] The problem is presented and a committee is established. This committee will typically work with consultants to specify the requirements of the solution.
	\item[Implementation phase] The solution will be implemented. 


\end{description}


Between the decision phase and the implementation phase, the project will be announced as a public supply contract for suppliers to tender. \cite{Union2004}. Suppliers will then submit their solutions. The solution that fits the problem's requirements best, gets the contract.
