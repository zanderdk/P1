This section will describe how the organizational structure of a hospital is and how the existing infrastructure of a hospital is including requirements for a navigation system.

\input{Chapters/problem_analysis/interessent_admin.tex}

\subsection{Infrastructure}

In order to create a good navigational system for a hospital, certain factors must be considered. When deciding new features for a hospital, installation \& maintenance costs and compatibility with the existing hardware are big subjects. Therefore this section will describe existing infrastructure in hospitals and how this will affect the navigational system.

\paragraph{Wi-Fi} \label{orgwifi}

Most hospitals have good Wi-Fi coverage in the facility \cite{Millionkontrakt_giver_Ca}. A visit to \enquote{Sygehus Nord} in Aalborg revealed that multiple locations around the hospital had a sufficient amount of Wi-Fi hot spots in range, in order to be used in Location Based Services. See \cref{fig:wifi1,fig:wifi2,fig:wifi3}.

\paragraph{Interference with medical device}

Incidents of radio frequency interference between cellular phones, radio broadcasters, WiFi devices and medical devices have been reported. Older models of pacemakers, defibrillator and hearing aid devices were being influenced by near encounter of cellular phones causing undesirable effects which could lead to uncontrollable heartbeat. 
The problem was that radio frequency fields were interfering with medical equipment. This has however now been addressed in modern standards, meaning that interference with medical devices does not occur any more. \cite{Man1998,Case}

\paragraph{Temporary out-of-order elements}

When mapping a hospital every hall building, stair, elevator etc. has to be considered. Situations may however occur in which some of the mapped elements in fact are temporarily out-of-order. This could be an elevator or a hallway being repainted. Updating the navigation system map to include the temporary elements would be a lot of effort. In a situation in which an user of the navigation system is guided through an out-of-order element, the user will most likely find their own way around this obstacle. When this happens, the user is going off-route. The navigation system must support this and act accordingly.

\paragraph{Cross-building support}

Some hospitals will undoubtedly have several building complexes around their cadastral. A good navigational system should work across these platforms providing one, uniform experience. This is both good for the end-user but also eases the maintenance work for the the navigational, because it can be reused across many different hospitals. If support for cross-building complexes has been laid, this could further expand to the navigation system supporting different hospitals independent of each other. The navigation system could then e.g. be installed in all the hospitals in Region Nordjylland, providing an uniform experience for end-users.

\subsection{Summary of organization}

To round up, the extra workload that can occur when navigating in a hospital is a problem, because it is time consuming and stressful for both the regular staff and the visitors. The problem is not only affecting visitors but also the staff working at the hospital. 

Changes in a hospital can occur when the region decides to save or spend money. The infrastructure or structure in general can be modified. When these decisions are made, 3 different phases are typically executed: preparing phase, decision phase and implementation phase. When changes are to be made, installation \& maintenance costs and compatibility with the existing hardware, are big subjects.
