\subsection{Location Fingerprinting}
In location fingerprinting, there are to main tecniques that have been choosen for this project. It is "QR-code" and "RFID".
Location fingerprinting is method of recognizing devices by giving them a electronic fingerprint, such as a unique id.

\paragraph{QR-code} % (fold)
QR-codes are barcodes that returns data when scanned. The code is represented by black boxes on a white square grid background. All by how the boxes are arranged, the code will represent different data.

In order to read the data, a scanner has to be used. A camera from a smartphone can be used for this purpose, as long there are an app that supports this particular format. Such apps can be found on nearly all smartphones\cite{QR_smart}. The QR-code can be used to lead users to websites, and are used often in different kind of commercial ways\cite{QR_url}.

It is easy to read the QR-code if you already have an app installed on your smartphone. It is also easy to make your own codes as Google have released a free tool to generate them\cite{QR_Google}.It is also rather easy to set up a QR-code system in a effective way\cite{QR_easy}.

The relevance for this project is how it will take little to no time to set up\cite{QR_rel1}, and how some people already knows how use them as they are widely spread\cite{QR_spread}. Even if a code is damaged it will still be usable, all up to 30\% of the code can be missing\cite{QR_dama}. This also means it will be possible to implant images in the code and still have it working\cite{QR_image}.

A reason for not to use the codes could be that some users might exploit the system. If they print their own codes with links to certain websites it could be a very unpleasant experience for the other users\cite{QR_urlbad}. In worst case scenarios they could be used to steal personal information\cite{QR_information}.
In order for the codes to be efficient, they also have to placed at many locations at the hospital. The users should always be able to find them when they want to use them. This could leave to frustration if they seems to be nowhere to find for the user.

RFID (Radio Frequency Identification) is a radio technology that makes it possible, just like barcodes, to identify different objects. the main difference between these two technologies is that the barcode is a line of sight technology, and RFID is wireless, as long as it is within visible distance. The readable distance varies depending on the type of RFID tag. The information exchanged can be in many different formats such as text, numbers, audio or video. The signal is send with via magnetic fields\cite{RFID_magnetic}.

There are, different RFID tags, as they can be passive, active or battery-assisted. Tags can be read-only "one time read" or read-write "multiply times", have a serial number, or can be plank for the owner to write something on it. To put it into perspective to our project, a read-only tag can be used to find an object such as a printer that does not change its name or property. Read-write tag, can be used to track patients, the information can chance the name and CPR number to match the person who wears it.
