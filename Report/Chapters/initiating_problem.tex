\chapter{Initiating problem}
\textit{In this chapter we will cover different problems associated with indoor navigation in a hospital. We will formulate our initiating problem, based on the issues that we relate to indoor navigation, and navigation in three dimensions. In the problem analysis we will work on the initiating problem, and delimit our initiating problem down to one problem statement, that we will try to solve.
