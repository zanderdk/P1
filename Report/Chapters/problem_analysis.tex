%\{How can indoor navigation in hospitals be optimized by generating a specific route for individuals with different prerequisites?}
Our \textbf{initiating problem} is:

\begin{displayquote}
    \textit{How can a software solution optimize indoor navigation in Danish hospitals for visitors and patients with different prerequisites?}\label{sub:init}
\end{displayquote}

\sinote{Vi må ikke skrive interesting bare fordi vi synes det. Belæg for at det er interessant samf. relevant.}
We formulated our initiating problem on the basis of the research we conducted on the subject, "Indoor Navigation in Hospitals". We choose this initiating problem because we thought it interesting, yet still delimited sufficient enough for us to base our project upon it. In the following chapters we will clarify and analyse the aspects relevant to our initiating problem.
