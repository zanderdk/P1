\chapter{Problem Analysis} \label{cha:problem_analysis}
This chapter will describe and analyse different aspect of the initiating problem. In the section social relevance, our society will be viewed in relative to the initiating problem and the way our society adapt new technology in general. In the analogue navigation section different current systems will be examined in order to draw experience from their strengths and weaknesses, for consideration when developing a solution. Thereafter the traits of the main stakeholders will be analysed, to give insight into the problems the stakeholders encounter when navigating. In the organization section, the infrastructure of a hospital will be studied in order to determine what to consider when implementing a solution at a hospital. In the section on technology, technologies relevant to navigation, this being \textbf{mapping} and positioning, and relaying information, will be analysed. A method will be applied to determine whether a technology will be of use in a possible solution, and if so; in what way.
