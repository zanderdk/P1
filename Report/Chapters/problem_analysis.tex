Anders's kapitel - eksisterende systemer

The phone
Visitors is able to call the hospitals main number and ask questions to a live operator. This can be done from any phone but there is no ensurance that a live operator is at disposel to answer the phone.

Signs
There are signs that marks different areas of the hospital. "Main entrance" and "Ambulance entrance" these signs can be used to mark key places that the visitor can navigate from.
There are also placed interior signs in the hospital. Signs painted to the walls, signs affixed to doors or windows and others hang from the ceiling. These signs describes what rooms you are in or what the hall the reader is in. Some of these signs also contains information about where the different areas of the hospital can be located, often marked by a line of text followed up by a arrow pointing in a specified direction.   

Maps
Maps offers a top down view of the hospital with all the different ocations marked by text or a colour. The map can be painted on a wall or found in a compact version meant to be carried around. The stationary maps often have a red dot that points out were the reader is. If the building have multiple floors, the map will be split up into sections in order to cover all the rooms.

The receptionist
The receptionist will answer questions from the visitors. Very much alike the phone, but with some key diffferences. The phone is more accesabel as the one who calls does not need to be at a certain location. The receptions has an advantgae for being more precise. There will be less confusion as bodyanguage can be used in the answering of the question.

Colour coding
Coloured stripes across the wall or floor that leads to the different areas of the hospital. In the entrance hall the visitors will se a wall with some lines of text with a coloured stripe behind it. One line might say "recovery" and if followed, will lead to the recovery department. Some departsment also have an entire theme in a certain colour. In this way it might become easier for some people to navigate the next time they visit if they can remember the colours for a department. 

Porter*
The porter helps patients and visitors get around at the hospital. If a patient is dead, the porter transport the corpse to the chapel. The porter also helps visitors find available beds if they have to stay at the hospital overnight.
