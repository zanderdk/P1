%\{How can indoor navigation in hospitals be optimized by generating a specific route for individuals with different prerequisites?}
Our \textbf{initiating problem} is:

\begin{displayquote}
    \textit{How can a software solution optimize indoor navigation in Danish hospitals for visitors and patients with different prerequisites?}\label{sub:init}
\end{displayquote}

We formulated our initiating problem on the basis of the research we conducted on the subject, "Indoor Navigation in Hospitals". We choose this initiating problem because, todays hospitals or generaly buildings are getting bigger and more complex, this is a issue, and in the following chapters we will clarify and analyse the aspects relevant to our prolem. This analyse will cover socaial relevans, todays hospitals, the techloligy about navigation, and Theory behind it. and in the end, our solutions to some of the problem with navigation.
