\section{Abstract}

    A modern day hospitals often exists of complex, multiple floor and buildings, and such environments can be quite difficult to navigate. Handicapped users in wheelchairs and mental deceases like claustrophobia or general fear of elevators, can cause further problems when navigating between altitudes, when the only means of transportation is stairs and elevators. Already established navigational systems does not operate well indoor, and such possibilities in indoor navigation does not often does not exist, therefore this project set out to solve the problem; how can a software solution optimize indoor navigation in Danish hospitals for visitors and patients with different prerequisites?
