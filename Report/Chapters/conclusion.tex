\chapter{Conclusion}

To conclude, the aim of this report was to analyse the need for and the requirements of an indoor navigation software system, which would allow users to personalize their navigation, in order to offer a better alternative when navigating a large building complex, such as a hospital. It was shown that many pathfinding issues are not being met by current navigation methods, and that certain usergroups are not able to effectively utilize the current systems. In order to combat this, newer technologies with relation to navigation was examined for insight into a way of solving the problems. The demands that needs to be met were defined and due to time constraint, a delimenation was made in order to focus the effort on a core of requirements.
