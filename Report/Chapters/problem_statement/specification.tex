\begin{itemize}
	\item The program must be able to generate a route to a user given destination.
	\item The user must have the ability to personalize the generated route through the following parameters.
			\begin{itemize}
				\item Are stairs to be avoided or preferred?
				\item Are elevators to be avoided or preferred?
				\item Are disabled-friendly routes a must?
				\item Should the route be fastest in time, shortest in distance, or have the least number of climbs like stairs?
			\end{itemize}
	\item The program must represent the route instructions either as text, audio or pictographic.
	\item The program must be accessible from the (three) most popular mobile operating systems. \sinote{Three skal måske senere rettes}
	\item The program must be able to support different building complexes while a map is available.
	\item The program must be able to manage maps from external sources.
	\item The user interface must be intuitive, simple but still give a quick overview of data representation.
	\item The program should cache up to 50MB of maps in order to save bandwidth.
	\item The program must update its position at start, at each route branch and if the device is going off the route.
	\item The program must maintain the user's position without communicating with external factors.
	\item The program must be able to position itself by the use of radio triangulation or location fingerprinting.
	\item The maximum waiting time during initial route generation must not exceed 2 seconds.
\end{itemize}

\sinote{til analysen: Kilden vurderer den samlede accepterede ventetid til mellem 2 og 4 sekunder [http://cba.unl.edu/research/articles/548/download.pdf]}

\sinote{til løsningen: Vi afsætter 500 ms til selve rutegenereringen, som måles fra modtagelse af positionsdata og ruteindstillinger, til udregningen af ruten er færdiggjort. Dette giver minimum 1500 ms til at repræsentere instrukser.}
