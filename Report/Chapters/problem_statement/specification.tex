What follows is a list of requirements that needs to be met, before a solution can be considered complete. These specifications are based on discoveries made in the analysis of the initial problem. Each requirement will be followed by a short description of why it is nessesary for a complete solution, and references to which parts of the analysis that supports it.

\subsection{Usage requirements}

Usage requirements are needs that must be met, before the solution can be considered to be meeting any and all anticipated users basic expectations for the interaction with the solution. This does not include any underlying computations, but only the ways of giving input to and representing of those computations, in compliance with the needs of the using stakeholders described in \cref{sec:interusers}.

\begin{itemize}
	\item The user must have the ability to personalize the generated route through the following parameters.
			\begin{itemize}
				\item Are stairs to be avoided or preferred?
				\item Are elevators to be avoided or preferred?
				\item Are disabled-friendly routes a must?
				\item Should the route be fastest in time, shortest in distance, or the least physical strenuous?
			\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
In order to optimize navigation, the limits of systems in current use must be considered. See \cref{sec:anal_nav}. A system that does not take personalized input from a user, will not be able to consider the needs for that particular user. As described in \cref{sec:interusers} these needs can differs immensely across usergroups, and therefore it is important to be able to personalize the generated route.
The first three parameters are able to establish most bounderies the users might have, wether it is physical or psychological, while still keeping input to a minimum, another requirement we expand on later. The last parameter is less essential, since all usergroups could always use the least physical strenuous, however in order to optimize the route specifically for the user, this option should be given as well. This last parameter could also be an indrect input, based on other input, such as the travelling speed of the user and previous choices. In any way, the program should be able to choose different criterias for the choice of optimal route.

\begin{itemize}
	\item[2] The user interface must be intuitive, simple but still give a quick overview of data representation.
	\item[2] The maximum waiting time during initial route generation must not exceed 2 seconds.
	\item[2] The program must represent the route instructions either as text, audio or pictographic.
\end{itemize}


\subsection{Technical requirements}

\begin{itemize}
	\item The program must be able to generate a route to a given destination. 
		{Problems with current navigation systems, include relying on the users ability to figure out the optimal route with sometimes confusing information displayed by a stationaire map. See \cref{sub:map}. In a software solution this could, and should, be handled by the system.}
	\item The program must be able to position itself by the use of radio triangulation or location fingerprinting.
	\item The program must maintain the user's position without communicating with external factors.
	\item The program must be able to detect deviation from the route, and recalculate accordingly.
	\item The program must be able to support different building complexes.
\end{itemize}



\sinote{til analysen: Kilden vurderer den samlede accepterede ventetid til mellem 2 og 4 sekunder [http://cba.unl.edu/research/articles/548/download.pdf]}

\sinote{til løsningen: Vi afsætter 500 ms til selve rutegenereringen, som måles fra modtagelse af positionsdata og ruteindstillinger, til udregningen af ruten er færdiggjort. Dette giver minimum 1500 ms til at repræsentere instrukser.}
