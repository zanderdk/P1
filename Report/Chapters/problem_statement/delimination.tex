In the following solution, the requirements which will be focused on, and be resolved are:

\begin{itemize}
  \item The user must have the possibility, but not be required, to personalize the generated route through the following parameters:
      \begin{itemize}
        \item Are stairs to be avoided or preferred?
        \item Are elevators to be avoided or preferred?
      \end{itemize}
  \item The maximum wait during route generation should not under normal conditions exceed 2 seconds.

  \item The program must be able to generate the optimal route to a given destination.

  \item The program must be able to support different building complexes.

\end{itemize}
