\section{Delimitation}\label{sec:delimination}

\sinote{ kasper: jeg skrev lidt om.. skal lige vurderes}

Due to time constraints the solution created in this project requires delimitation.

In the following solution, the requirements which will be focused on, and be resolved are:

\begin{itemize}
  \item The user must have the possibility, but not be required, to personalize the generated route through the following parameters:
      \begin{itemize}
        \item Are stairs to be avoided or preferred?
        \item Are elevators to be avoided or preferred?
      \end{itemize}
  \item The maximum wait during route generation should not under normal conditions exceed 2 seconds.

  \item The program must be able to generate the optimal route to a given destination.

  \item The program must be able to support different building complexes.

\end{itemize}

These requirements were chosen, due to their level of importance and severity. Judged as being the most essential requirements, it was assessed that when solved, they would create a base from which further requirements would have little to no structural conflicts, and will be relatively easy to incorporate. They also pose the greatest challenge to the innovators creativity, and will require rethinking ways of incorporating established technology into the solution.
