\subsection{Multiple Layer Navigation through FLAWLESS} \label{multlayhan}

The Dijkstra algorithm is proven by mathematics, to always find the shortest route between two vertices. But because Dijkstra always calculates every possible path until it gets to the desired destination, a lot of calculations are necessary. If some of these calculations could be avoided, the runtime would be lowered which would suite the usage requirement in \cref{irm_tid}. By using A*, the amount of calculations can be reduced because of the logic the algorithm uses, when admissible values are applied correctly.

But when using A* to find a path, the use of a euclidean heuristic becomes problematic when traversing multiple floors in a building. \Cref{fig:buildingAstar1} helps illustrate this. If a euclidean heuristic is used, the algorithm will, whenever it enters a new floor, move towards the coordinate that is directly below the desired goal (the red dot), regardless of whether it is an exit vertex or not. See \cref{e_vertex}. After this point has been reached, as shown in \cref{fig:buildingAstar2}, the A* algorithm will expand the search from this vertex, which is shown in \cref{fig:buildingAstar3}. This will immensely decrease the usefulness of the euclidean heuristic, to a point where the A* algorithm might no longer be preferable to Dijkstra's algorithm. Because a low runtime is required for the solution, a better way of traversing floors must be employed.

The solution to this problem lies in a tripartitioning of the pathfinding process, and is illustrated in \cref{fig:flawless1,fig:flawless2,fig:flawless3} which will be explained in detail later on. This method of handing multiple floors in a building is named fused locale A* with level-calculation executed at system startup, and shortened to FLAWLESS. This algorithm combination is designed by student group SW1-B2-6 of 2013 at Aalborg University.

Because of building layouts normally having a low level of exit vertices, it is possible to keep a precalculated record of the optimal routes between these. This method can be used to reduce the response time when prompted for a route significantly.
After this all that is needed to be done, is to calculate the route to all the exit vertices on the initial floor, and again on the destination floor. Finally the best combination of routes from these three steps is returned as the optimal path from start to destination.

When using this approach, the precalculation is executed at system startup using Dijkstra's algorithm, in order to get the optimal connections between all exit vertices. There is no need for a faster algorithm, since there is no user communication during this calculation.

\Cref{fig:flawless1} is an illustration of a navigation problem. Shown on the illustration are the initial vertex, the destination vertex, and the exit vertices on each floor. The darker grey layer in the middle is representing the precalculated area between the floors exit vertices. The user will then prompt for a route from the initial vertex to the destination vertex.

    \label{fig:flawless1}
  \end{figure}

In \cref{fig:flawless2} the runtime is showing to consist of a round of A* runs done on both the initial floor and the destination floor. These runs are done from the start vertex and the destination vertex to all exit vertices on their respective floors.

    \label{fig:flawless2}
  \end{figure}

When this has been computed, all the possible combinations of paths will have their individual evaluation values added, and a comparison between the total evaluation values will determine the optimal path across the multiple floors as shown in \cref{fig:flawless3}.

  \end{figure}


\subsection{Choosing Stairs or the Elevator}

When the algorithm decides whether to choose stairs over elevators when travelling to another floor, the choice is determined by the weight of the route. The weight is based on how time consuming or psychical fatiguing the process is for the user. In order to weight the vertex in a way that reflects reality the stairs weight should grow exponentially. The more stairs a user climbs in succession the more psychical fatiguing it gets which is the reasoning for the exponential growth. This has however been delimited in \cref{sec:delimination} and both the stairs and elevator will therefore be weighted in a linear manner. \Cref{fig:labeled_stairsVSelevators} shows a graph with the stairs and elevator. The elevator starts with a higher initial weight as it takes time to call and enter the elevator, and then select a destination floor. In contrast the stairs start ascending as soon the user is on the first step. But once the user is inside the elevator, and it starts ascending, it will catch up on the stairs and eventually become the fastest way of travelling. On the graph, the point where the elevator is faster than the stairs, is where the two lines cross, which in this case is between the fourth and third floor. This means if the user has to travel four or more floors, the planned route should utilize the elevator.

  \end{figure}


In \cref{sec:interusers} different people have been described each with their own characteristics, and as concluded, some people don't have the opportunity to take the elevators or the stairs. 

To avoid adding a specific vertex such as an elevator or a stair, the weight connecting this specific vertex is multiplied with an extremely high number. This means that when the search algorithm travels through the graph, it will not consider e.g. the stairs.
Another way of resolving the problem is to stop the algorithm from considering the specified vertex is by disabling it. That way the algorithm will never visit this vertex. A problem with this is if the disabled vertex is the only way to the destination, then there is no possible path to destination.
