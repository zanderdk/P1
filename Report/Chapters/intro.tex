\chapter{Introduction}

Do you remember the days, when you had to go on a road trip and printed out written instructions, or had to use a map to path your way? Well we barely do. We all use gps navigation and have no intention of going back to the old system. But even though it has been so many years since we stopped using manual wayfinding in cars, we still have not figured out an effiecient way to incorporate computers into indoor navigation. Why does the navigation assistance stop at the entrance, even though the hardest part of finding your way, might just start at the exact same moment? We feel this problem needs to be adressed, especially in a streamlined facilties such as hospitals, where the pressure from society to optmize is constantly increasing.
