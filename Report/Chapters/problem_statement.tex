In the problem analysis we covered the different problems associated with indoor navigation in a hospital.
We discovered that there are many problems tied to the use of analogue navigation systems. We now have knowledge about the incompatibility with indoor navigations, and existing technologies such as GPS.
% Based on the problem analysis (\cref{cha:problem_analysis}), we have delimited the initiating problem (\cref{sub:init}) to one problem statement:

% \textit{\textbf{How can a software solution create an individually optimized indoor navigation path, through the use of an established positioning system and a portable computing device?}}


With this knowledge we designed a specification for a possible solution.


\input{Chapters/problem_statement/specification.tex}

This specification outlines a solution to the initial problem. In order to solve this solution it has to be split up into several subproblems.

\begin{itemize}
	\item How can a device position a user inside a multi layered building where GPS is not accesible?
	\item How can a device calculate a route inside a multi layered building suiting user preferences?
	\item How can a route be represented to a potentially disabled user in an intuitive way that still allows for a quick overview.
\end{itemize}

In this paper we will design a solution that fits the \fordinal{2} subproblem. This leaves us with the following problem statement:

\begin{displayquote}
    \textit{How can a device calculate a route inside a multi layered building suiting user preferences?}\label{sub:problem_statement}
\end{displayquote}
