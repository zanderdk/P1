\chapter{Problem Statement}

In the problem analysis, insight into the extend of the initial problem was given. The different aspects that was analyzed, created an outline for a problem solution. This outline serves as a guidance in understanding the many requirements the different stakeholders might have, and the ability to fit this outline, will determine the success of the solution.

The outline is however quite major, and since this report only strides towards solving a software solution, the following question was created as a problem statement, in order to limit the solution to only be concerned with software.

\begin{displayquote}
    \textit{How can a software solution create an individually optimized indoor navigation path, through the use of an established positioning system and a portable computing device?}\label{sub:problem_statement}
\end{displayquote}
