In the problem analysis we covered the different problems associated with indoor navigation in a hospital.
We discovered that there are many problems tied to the use of analogue navigation systems. We now have knowledge about the incompatibility with indoor navigations, and existing technologies such as GPS.
Based on the problem analysis (\cref{cha:problem_analysis}), we have delimited the initiating problem (\cref{sub:init}) to one problem statement:

\begin{displayquote}
    \textit{How can a software solution create an individually optimized indoor navigation path, through the use of an established positioning system and a portable computing device?}\label{sub:problem_statement}
\end{displayquote}

\begin{itemize}
	\item How can a device position a user inside a multi layered building where GPS is not accesible?
	\item How can a software solution compute a route inside a multi layered building suiting a users preferences?
	\item How can a route be represented to a potentially disabled user in an intuitive way that still allows for a quick overview.
\end{itemize}

%In this paper we will design a solution that fits the \fordinal{2} subproblem. This leaves us with the following problem statement
