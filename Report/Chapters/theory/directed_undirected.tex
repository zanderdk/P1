\subsection{Directed and Undirected Graphs}

\cref{fig:labeled_Directed_undirected} shows two graphs, one is directed and the other is undirected. Graph 1 is undirected and does not have a specific direction. Graph 2 is directed which means the edges is one way only. The arrows indicates the direction the edges allow. This means vertex 1 can go to vertex 2 and 3, but neither can go back.
