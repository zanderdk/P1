\section{Graph theory}

Graph theory is frequently used in computer science to model some kind of relationship between objects. These objects could be anything. Graph theory is a preferred method to model building complexes, because it can precisely model how e.g. a hallway in a hospital is connected to a room.

In graph theory objects are called \enquote{nodes} or \enquote{vertices}. The two terms can be used interchangeably. In this report, vertices will describe locations or POI (points of interest) in a hospital. Another term in graph theory is an edge. This is basically connecting two vertices and thereby providing a relationship between these vertices. See \cref{fig:labeled_graph}. An edge can be seen as a possible route connecting one location to another. Now in order to describe the relationship between two vertices, we use an weighted graph in which an edge has a number attribute called a weight. A weight can describe the time, distance or any other metric that in some way can describe how two connected vertices are related\cite{wiki_graph_glos,MIT2012}.

We can describe these definitions formally.\cite{MIT2012}
\begin{mydef}
	A graph $G$ is a pair of sets $(V,E)$ where $V$ is a non-empty set of items called vertices or nodes. $E$ is a set of 2-item subsets of $V$ called edges.
\end{mydef}
