\section{Graph theory}

Graph theory is frequently used in computer science to model some kind of relationship between objects. These objects could be anything. Graph theory is a preferred method to model building complexes, because it can precisely model how e.g. a hallway in a hospital is connected to a room.

In graph theory objects are called \enquote{nodes} or \enquote{vertices}. The two terms can be used interchangeably. In this report, vertices will describe locations or points of interest in a hospital. Another term in graph theory is an edge. An edge is a connection between two vertices and representing a relationship between these vertices. An edge can be seen as a possible route connecting one location to another. In order to describe the relationship between two vertices, a weighted graph in which an edge has an attribute called a weight. A weight can describe the time, distance or any other metric that in some way can describe how two connected vertices are related \cite{wiki_graph_glos,MIT2012}.

For an example of a weighted graph, see \cref{fig:graph}. All letters mark vertex ids. So circles are vertices. Edges are represented by lines connecting circles. The weight of the edge is represented by the numbers next to the line.

We can describe these definitions formally \cite{MIT2012}.
\begin{mydef}
	A graph $G$ is a pair of sets $(V,E)$ where $V$ is a non-empty set of items called vertices or nodes. $E$ is a set of 2-item subsets of $V$ called edges.
\end{mydef}

\subsection{Representation of graphs}

Two standard ways of representing a graph exists: as a collection of adjacency lists or as an adjacency matrix. Both representations support directed and undirected graphs. Each representation method has its own merits \cite{Cormen2009}.

\subsubsection{Adjacency list}
Adjacency lists provide a very compact way to represent sparse graphs, with the keyword being sparse. Adjacency lists are only compact and the preferred representation of graphs if the number of edges in a graph is much less than the number of vertices squared. \Cref{fig:graph,fig:labeled_Directed_undirected} are represented as a collection of adjacency lists.

\subsubsection{Adjacency matrix}
Adjacency matrices are usually the representation of choice when the graph is dense. This means that adjacency matrices should be used when the number of edges is close to the number of vertices squared. Adjacency matrices also has the merit of providing quick lookup of which vertices are connected. See \cref{fig:adjacency_matrix} for an example. Row and column numbers are vertex ids. The contents of the matrix represents the weights in the graph. So when finding the weight connecting vertex 3 and 4, one would look in row 4 column 3. The weight would then be 1. If the weight is 0, the two vertices are not connected.
