This image shows how the program will divide the task of finding the optimal route into four additional operations. 

  First: Use A* to find or search for all the available exit from the users start vertices's on the Start Floor.

  Second: Use Dj Pre. computed path, for all available Exit on the start floor to all available exit on the end floor.

  Third: Use A* to compute the optimal route from all available exit on the end floor to the goal vertices's. 

  Fourth: Combine the First, second and Third operation and compute the most optimal route from the start vertices's (start) through Dj pre. computed paths to the end vertices's (Goal).
