  \subsection{K Nearest Neighbour}

  The k-nearest-neighbour (k-NN) algorithm simply compares a data set to $k$ closest-neighbour data sets, meaning data sets that are close to the original data set. The closeness is called the distance and is typically computed using the Euclidean distance or the Hamming distance.\cite{Liu2007, wiki_knn}

  In location fingerprinting, k-NN uses the online Received Signal Strengths (RSS) to find the closest $k$ locations from the a priori RSS.
