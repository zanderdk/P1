The Dijkstra algorithm always finds the shortest route between two positions. But because Dijkstra always calculates every possible path until it gets to the desired destination, a lot of calculations are necessary. If some of these calculations could be avoided, the runtime would be lowered which would suite the usage requirement\cref{irm_tid}. By using A*, the amount of calculations can be reduced because of the logic the algorithm uses, when admissible values are applied correctly.
