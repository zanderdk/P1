\chapter{Theory}

This chapter describes some theory needed in order to implement the solution presented in \cref{cha:solution} and why this theory is chosen. The chosen theory includes graph theory for modelling building complexes, wayfinding algorithms for searching through graphs finding the most optimal route.
