\chapter{Theory}

This chapter describes all theory needed in order to implement the solution presented in \cref{cha:solution} and why this theory is chosen. The chosen theory includes graph theory for modelling building complexes, wayfinding algorithms for searching through graphs find the most optimal route and how the general software architecture of the solution is.
