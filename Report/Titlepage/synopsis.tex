    A modern hospital often consists of multi floored buildings, and such environments can be quite difficult to navigate, especially for individuals with psychical or psychological impairments. Already established navigational systems does not operate well indoor. Therefore this project will inspect the problem; how can a software solution optimize indoor navigation in Danish hospitals for visitors and patients with different prerequisites? 
    
    This problem was solved by the use of the FLAWLESS algorithm, implemented in the programming language C. Graph theory was utilized in modeling complexes like hospitals. The program can search the modeled graph and then calculate the most optimal path from a start to a destination location.
