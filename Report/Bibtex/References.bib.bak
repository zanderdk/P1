title={Indoor localization technique using passive RFID tags},

pages={922-926}, 
abstract={In this paper, radio frequency identification (RFID) technology is used for localization system. The location of a RFID reader is estimated based on the known locations of RFID tags using the UHF band RFID system. The new location estimation method based on the angulation technique is proposed to determine the reader location in real time. For angulation technique, the RFID reader is held on the camera tripod and it is considered as the target to be localized. The passive tags are attached at the known location and considered as the references. In this case, the RFID tags are put in the horizontal straight line on different sides on the walls (around the corner). The required parameter is the angle between the tag and the reader. In this paper, a compass is employed to measure the angle between the tag and the reader. Therefore, at least two angles are needed and further used to calculate the true location of the reader by using two formulated linear equations. This technique is verified using the experiment data. Two experiments are conducted with two different distances between tags and reader, i.e. 100 cm and 150 cm. The experiment results of location estimation show that the average location estimation error is around 16 cm for the 100 cm distance and around 20 cm for the 150 cm distance. This implies that the proposed method is satisfied to use for indoor applications.},

	years. These systems have been successfully used in many applications
	such as asset tracking and inventory management. This paper provides
	an overview of the existing wireless indoor positioning solutions
	and attempts to classify different techniques and systems. Three
	typical location estimation schemes of triangulation, scene analysis,
	and proximity are analyzed. We also discuss location fingerprinting
	in detail since it is used in most current system or solutions. We
	then examine a set of properties by which location systems are evaluated,
	and apply this evaluation method to survey a number of existing systems.
	Comprehensive performance comparisons including accuracy, precision,
	complexity, scalability, robustness, and cost are presented.},

  abstract = {Biologically-inspired swarm of robots with collaboration towards a
	common mission has a broad range of applications. However, the required
	dynamic localization among autonomous robots for such swarm collaboration,
	though usually implicitly assumed, has not been properly studied.
	In this paper, we address the roles of multiple antennas in localization
	and energy-efficient wireless communications for a swarm of robots.
	Following the gradient of signal powers along a trajectory, a robot
	can track the direction of a source robot. With three or more properly
	placed antennas that sense different phase shifts of carrier, a robot
	can localize a source. By lateration, three collaborative robots
	can localize a source with known distances to it. Via angulation
	technique, three robots can determine their geometric relationship
	with knowing two angles and one distance between them. The techniques
	can be extended from the 2-D to the 3-D space for application of
	wall-climbing robots. On the basis of knowledge of robot locations,
	beamforming techniques can be employed to receive and transmit signal
	towards the desired robot therefore improving energy efficiency and
	prolonging robot lifetime.},
