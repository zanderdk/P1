  abstract = {Wireless indoor positioning systems have become very popular in recent
	years. These systems have been successfully used in many applications
	such as asset tracking and inventory management. This paper provides
	an overview of the existing wireless indoor positioning solutions
	and attempts to classify different techniques and systems. Three
	typical location estimation schemes of triangulation, scene analysis,
	and proximity are analyzed. We also discuss location fingerprinting
	in detail since it is used in most current system or solutions. We
	then examine a set of properties by which location systems are evaluated,
	and apply this evaluation method to survey a number of existing systems.
	Comprehensive performance comparisons including accuracy, precision,
	complexity, scalability, robustness, and cost are presented.},
