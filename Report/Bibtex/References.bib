   abstract = {Wireless indoor positioning systems have become very popular in recent
   years. These systems have been successfully used in many applications
   such as asset tracking and inventory management. This paper provides
   an overview of the existing wireless indoor positioning solutions
   and attempts to classify different techniques and systems. Three
   typical location estimation schemes of triangulation, scene analysis,
   and proximity are analyzed. We also discuss location fingerprinting
   in detail since it is used in most current system or solutions. We
   then examine a set of properties by which location systems are evaluated,
   and apply this evaluation method to survey a number of existing systems.
   Comprehensive performance comparisons including accuracy, precision,
   complexity, scalability, robustness, and cost are presented.},
